scrollview
 can have only child view to scroll.or we can add a layout as a single child view which further can contain
 multiple views.If you want to scroll only 1 view (for eg. Textview) u can directly put it in the scrollview.

to enable data binding , go in android section of app module level gradle and enable db =true & sync

2.16 ---> data binding : data     (pending)

doubt:-
 setBackground vs setBackgroundResource
