2.up button works same as back button of android os , but up button should not be present on home screen (bcoz it's task i to traverse back on previously visited screens of that app**) or
starting screen  to put user outside of the app , becoz  we already have back button. 
3.Action Bar is for app branding & tells on which screen we are(eg.home,notification,settings etc.)
4.overflow menu is a dropdown to reach some navigation destinations.
5.Android introduced fragments in API Level 11.

The activity acts as a frame that contains ui fragments and can provide ui elements that surround the fragment
UI fragments generally operate like a view within activity's layout.
we may implement most ui logic in fragments but OS only has access to activities , so activity is the entry pt to OS.without activity u can't access fragments.
