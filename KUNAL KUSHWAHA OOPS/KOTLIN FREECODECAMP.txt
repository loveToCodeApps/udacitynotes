KOTLIN BASICS TUTORIAL
1. There are no semicolons ( ; ) used in kotlin at end of statement. BUT you can use semicolons ( ; ).

2. everything executes in main() function
   eg.  fun main()
	{
	    print("hello world")   OR  println("hello world")
	}

3.variables are of 2 types :-  1) var(these varibles can be reassigned). 2) val(these can't be reassigned, like final variables in java)
4. SYNTAX OF VARIABLE DECLARATION :- 
	var name:String="sagar thorat"
                                         OR
	var name="sagar thorat"  <---( HERE IT IS AUTOMATICALLY PREDICTING IT AS INTEGER , THIS IS CALLED TYPE INFERENCE, SO IF U REASSIGNED OTHER TYPE VALUE IT WILL GIVE ERROR)

5.TYPES IN KOTLIN ARE NON-NULL BY-DEFAULT.BECOZ  OF LOT OF NULL POINTER EXCEPTIONS IN JAVA.
 .I.E. STRINGS IN KOTLIN ARE NON-NULLABLE
   SO,
	var name:String=null  OR var name=null <---  // ERROR

BUT FOR SOME OCCASIONS , YOU CAN MAKE STRINGS AS NULL BY PUTTING QUESTION MARK ON RHS OF DATA TYPE STRING.
       eg.
	var name:String?=null  <--- // NO ERROR

6.WE CAN DECLARE VARIABLES OUTSIDE OF main() FUNCTION.
