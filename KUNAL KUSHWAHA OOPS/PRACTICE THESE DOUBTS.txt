    practice Remaining :-

1. singleton class - class that can have only one object.
2. calling a constructor from another constructor.
3.why we cant have static variable in a static method ? 
4. passing object as parameter in child constructor(VIMP ALSO CHECK HOW SUPER() CONSTRUCTOR WORKS , I KNOW
THAT BUT STILL AGAIN REVISE I , VERY COOL STUFF)
