UNDERSTOOD TOPICS
1.Random()  class 
PROBLEM 1:-
import random() class from (java.util)

here if we just assigned a random.nextInt(6)+1  to a variable then it will be called only once , so we will get only same value again and again.
but to get random values we need to put that line in a function , so everytime a function get's called it will assign a different random value every time.

PROBLEM 2 :-
DECLARING GLOBAL VARIABLES FOR findViewById()
we can set lateinit var to null , but it will become necessary to do null checks
calling findViewById() from a functions needs memory to go through that hierarchy of views so simple phone can lag , so solution is to declare global findViewById():-
1.use lateinit var  :- it tells compiler  that variable will be initialzied before use and will not be null , so 
		lateinit var diceimage:ImageView
2. IN onCreateView IT IS MUST TO INITIZE LATEINIT VAR BEFORE USE .
       SO ,    diceimage=findViewById(R.id.dice_image_1)

3.
	android:src="@Drawable/empty_dice"
	tools:src="@Drawable/dice_image_1"

sometimes we want to see the preview of app in preview panel , but empty_dice will show nothing in that case
use tools:src to show , to get idea of how our app will look like.At compilation tools:src will be ignored.
