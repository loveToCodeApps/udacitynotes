we need to refactor the id name of any view if we want to modify id of any view.
refactoring is important becoz we want to change it everywhere we use it, 
2 ways to do it:-
1.in xml code , right click on id and click on refactor.
2.in properties panel directly change and click on refactor.


in visibility property of any view:-
  invisibilty- view is not visible but still takes space on ui
  gone- view not visible + don't occupy ui space.



DATA BINDING :-
At compile time , data binding generates a binding class which is a helper class used to access views from activity/fragment when it is created without needing to traverse whole hierarchy of views.


IMP CONCEPTS
1. binding.apply()
2.invalidateAll()
