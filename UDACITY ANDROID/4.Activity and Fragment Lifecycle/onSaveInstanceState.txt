onsaveinstancestate()  is get called when activity goes in background. i.e. onStop()
and recovers data from bundle when activity comes in foreground.i.e onStart()/onRestart()

Bundle is just a collection of key-value pairs.
key will always be a string
we can generally store only about 100kb data in a bundle , if more then it will give 
transactionTooLargeException

onSaveInstanceState is used to store data in bundle and recover/restore it when:
1.you rotate your phone(here our app is in foreground)
2.OS shuts down / kill activity process to allocate resources to ongoing apps(here our app will be in background)


override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {}
Above , the bundle in which we will store store data , is passed in here above.
so if we are freshly creating an activity , we will have this bundle empty,
so by that logic , we will first check if it is null, by condion

if(savedInstanceState!=null)
{
}
 and if OS is recreating activity, then it will restore this bundle values


NOTE:- We are writing restoring bundle code in onCreate() because when we rotate
 phone/ when OS shuts down activity to allocate memory to other ongoing app and 
when we again get app on foreground  the activity gets created again .i.e. onCreate() 
gets called.
