How ot push project to Git ?
1.make a new repo on github and copy it's url
2.In pc , make a folder and initialise it with $ git init
3.then add remote origin
 $ git remote add origin URL
and check it using 
  $git remote -v
4.then add files to folder in pc and $add & $commit the changes made
5.then push changes to github
  $git push origin master
 that't it.


NOTE:- 
I added a ReadMe file in remote/online repo 
so it gave me error for pushing from local to remote
bcoz in remote/online i had ReadMe which wasn't in local folder
so first i need to pull this changes: 
	$ git pull origin master'
hen you can push your local changes
	$ git push origin master


2. if you delete file in local repo and comit and push it ,
then that file will not be visible in github but all the other commits related to it are visible with data.
