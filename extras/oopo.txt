while defining uiScope 
if you use ,  instead of +  , it will give you a n error in :-

    val uiScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main + viewModelJob)  // correct
    val uiScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Main , viewModelJob)  //error


2. always use camelcase to name packages/folders
don't start with capital , that error took me 3-4 hours to solve

PENDING
in,
fun onNavigateDone()
i use _navigateToSleepQuality = null
so it needed to make it nullable by adding ?
but udacity app don't have it ?
