how does this adapter patter pattern fits in the recyclerview?
in case of recyclerview , we have our app's data which we want to display as list.
we don't want to change the way our app stores or proesses the data , just to put it on the screen.
 so we built an adapter to adapt our data into something that can be use by recyclerview.
concretely our data is stored in a room database , we will build an adapter that adapts data from room db into
something that recyclerview knows how to display.

RecyclerView uses Adapter to figure out how to display your data on screen.

when it first starts out,
RV asks adapter that how many items there are , adapter says there are 100 , then RV immediately starts creating
the views needed just to show on first screen.
first RV asks adapter to create new view for the first data item in your list.
once it has view , it will ask adapter to draw the item.it repeats this until it doesn't need more space to fill the screen.
And it's done.It won't look at other items until user scrolls up. 
if item

viewholder - objects that holds views

step 1 - add recyclerview in place of scrollview in sleeptracker fragment
2.create a class for adapter , and extend it with recyclerview.Adapter<TextItemViewHolder> , here we need to tell 
recyclerview that what type of ViewHolder we are working with . for eg. TextItemViewHolder
3.Recyclerviews will never interact directly with views , all of its operations are performed on viewHolders.
