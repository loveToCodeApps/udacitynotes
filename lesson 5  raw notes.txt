In kotlin & Android -  Data   -  represented by -   Data Classes
And we need a way to act on that data & database -  In Kotlin - These are function calls


we use data classes to represent our tables.
and use annotations to specify things like which property represents primary key.
we create interfaces that define how to interact with the databases.

we will annotate the data class as Entity , by default  , the name for storing  instances of this entity is same as the class name.
we can specify the name of the table to be different from the name of the entity class.

if we pass parameter to primary key annotation as autoGenerate=true it will guarantee to generate unique values for our primary key

we will annotate remaining properties with annotation @ColumnInfo  ,  default name of annotation is same as variable name , but we can change it by passing (name = value)
